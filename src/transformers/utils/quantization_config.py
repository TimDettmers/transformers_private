@dataclass
class BitsAndBytesConfig:
    """
    This is a wrapper class about all possible attributes and features that you can play with a model that has been
    loaded using `bitsandbytes`.

    This replaces `load_in_8bit` therefore both options are mutually exclusive.

    For now, only arguments that are relative to `LLM.int8()` are supported, therefore the arguments are all termed as
    `llm_int8_*`. If more methods are added to `bitsandbytes`, then more arguments will be added to this class.

    Args:
        load_in_8bit (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used to enable 8-bit quantization with LLM.int8().
        load_in_4bit (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used to enable 4-bit quantization by replacing the Linear layers with FP4/NF4 layers from
            `bitsandbytes`.
        llm_int8_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 6):
            This corresponds to the outlier threshold for outlier detection as described in `LLM.int8() : 8-bit Matrix
            Multiplication for Transformers at Scale` paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339 Any hidden states value
            that is above this threshold will be considered an outlier and the operation on those values will be done
            in fp16. Values are usually normally distributed, that is, most values are in the range [-3.5, 3.5], but
            there are some exceptional systematic outliers that are very differently distributed for large models.
            These outliers are often in the interval [-60, -6] or [6, 60]. Int8 quantization works well for values of
            magnitude ~5, but beyond that, there is a significant performance penalty. A good default threshold is 6,
            but a lower threshold might be needed for more unstable models (small models, fine-tuning).
        llm_int8_skip_modules (`List[str]`, *optional*):
            An explicit list of the modules that we do not want to convert in 8-bit. This is useful for models such as
            Jukebox that has several heads in different places and not necessarily at the last position. For example
            for `CausalLM` models, the last `lm_head` is kept in its original `dtype`.
        llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used for advanced use cases and users that are aware of this feature. If you want to split
            your model in different parts and run some parts in int8 on GPU and some parts in fp32 on CPU, you can use
            this flag. This is useful for offloading large models such as `google/flan-t5-xxl`. Note that the int8
            operations will not be run on CPU.
        llm_int8_has_fp16_weight (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag runs LLM.int8() with 16-bit main weights. This is useful for fine-tuning as the weights do not
            have to be converted back and forth for the backward pass.
        fp4_compute_dtype (`torch.dtype`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            This sets the computational type which might be different than the input time. For example, inputs might
            be fp32, but computation can be set to bf16 for speedups.
        bnb_4bit_quant_type (`str`, {fp4, fn4}, defaults to `fp4`):
            This sets the quantization data type in the bnb.nn.Linear4Bit layers. Options are FP4 and NF4 data types
            which are specified by `fp4` or `fn4`.
        bnb_4bit_compress_statistics (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used for nested quantization where the quantization constants from the first quantization
            are quantized again.
